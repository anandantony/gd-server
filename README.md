<h1>A test Godot server</h1>
A UDP hole punching server in python + Godot Client

The python server is based on https://github.com/stylesuxx/udp-hole-punching/

Server requires Python 3 and Twisted: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

Usage: ./server.py PORT

This began as a fork of: https://github.com/dalton5000/tyson/blob/master/LICENSE, but has since been reimplemented and converted to a plugin.
